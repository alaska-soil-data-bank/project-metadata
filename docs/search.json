    "text": "Project Description\n[From Project Proposal] Approximately 300 million acres (&gt; 70%) of the NOTCOM areas in the United States are in Alaska. Little data is available in unmapped areas of Alaska in the NASIS database. Harnessing disparate non-NRCS legacy datasets for digital soil mapping initiatives in Alaska will therefore be critical for completing the Soils2026 initiative. In order to properly harness big data in soil survey in Alaska, where a significant amount of non-NRCS soil data exists in critical areas, we need to develop a platform that allows public/private data, provides attribution, is flexible and nimble enough to accept ongoing contributions without a large burden on the submitter, can be easily scaled, and can provide export workflows to ingest data into NASIS. The utility of such a database (what we will refer to as the Alaska Soil Data Bank – ASDB) will be demonstrated through the production of digital soil mapping products at multiple scales and using multiple methods. We will use the harmonized ASDB dataset and NASIS together to produce the first digital statewide predictive map of Alaska soil orders and suborders at 30m resolution, and apply a novel approach to digital soil mapping (using landscape segmentation analysis) for Katmai National Park and Preserve.",

We will acquire, curate, and centralize non-NRCS legacy data for the state of Alaska and stand up a database for continuing contributions on the G.E.M.S. platform of the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. The ASDB will result in a harmonized dataset for use in digital soil mapping in Alaska and scripts will be written to export the data into a NASIS-readable format for ingestion.\n2. AK Statewide Predictive Soil Order/Suborder Map. We will generate digital predictive soil order and soil suborder maps of the state of Alaska at a resolution of 30m.\n3. Segmentation Analysis Approach to DSM for Katmai National Park and Preserve. We will utilize a novel landscape segmentation analysis approach to digital soil mapping for Katmai National Park and Preserve.",

    "section": "1.3 Data Storage and Preservation",
    "text": "1.3 Data Storage and Preservation\nData generated by activities outlined in this proposal will be initially stored and maintained in the GEMS platform hosted in the data center of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI). MSI performs full off-site backups as part of their disaster recovery plan. GEMS has recurrent Minnesota State Government funding to maintain its core operations, currently with no expiry date. All registered data in GEMS is persistent, given a DataCite DOI minted by our University of Minnesota Libraries partners. In addition to storage in GEMS and linkage in metadata to original data sources whenever possible, harmonized data will be imported into NASIS in compatible, machine- readable format and therefore all data produced by the project will also be imported into NASIS prior to project end. Per the project narrative, the power of the GEMS platform is that datasets are input “as is”, maintaining the data structure of the original authors. GEMS metadata for each dataset includes full reference information. If the dataset is publicly available, the GEMS metadata for that dataset will include information on dataset access, storage platform, and author contact information. This metadata is in JSON format and can be reconfigured and exported for any metadata catalog (in this case specifically targeting the NOTCOM catalog maintained by the NRCS Initial Mapping Team) that may be maintained by NRCS. The GEMS platform excels at utilizing field metadata and fuzzy matching to enable post-input data harmonization. During the dataset input process, in addition to constructing dataset metadata, metadata tags are assigned to each dataset field from a dynamic data dictionary which can be expanded as necessary as more datasets are added. These field metadata tags then become the primary vehicle through which scripts are written to subsequently harmonize the data for export and usage in DSM. There are many advantages to this approach. The primary advantage is that datasets are imported “as is”, meaning that data will match the original data source and author format. This increases transparency because there is no prior “re-working” of data before it is added to the database. As scripts are written to harmonize datasets to a defined format using field metadata tags, these scripts will also be available on GitHub to enable any potential user to recreate the eventual harmonized dataset that is utilized for DSM. Finally, because scripting is used for harmonization, output format is flexible. This is critical, because scripts will be developed to harmonize data and output in a format which can be ingested into NASIS.\n\n1.3.1 Data Sharing, Protection and Public Access\nThe GEMS agroinformatics platform developed by the University of Minnesota supports the data interoperability and sharing needs of this project. GEMS adheres to and, via its extensive (and still expanding) data handling toolkit, makes practically possible, FAIR(ER) data sharing principles; findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, ethical—i.e., respects data sensitivities (e.g., partner sourced) or any proprietary (e.g., privately-sourced) data—and reproducible. Non-private data will be made open to the public via GEMS-Open, an open database of functionally interoperable and documented data that adheres to standard and harmonized meta-data protocols. When viewing and analyzing datasets, GEMS requires users to click licenses of each primary data source prior to receiving access to the data. Similarly, all data product derivatives are electronically tagged with links to the product sources in their metadata, ensuring proper credit attributions, as often described by their license agreements. The ASDB will adopt a data policy that accounts for data ownership, allows reuse of data and creation of data derivatives (e.g., pooling of soil data into new larger continental soil applications). We will adopt the Creative Commons Licensing scheme for data sharing and attributions. Importantly, the spectrum of private-public data sharing is accounted for in the ASDB. This is an important aspect because some soil data have inherent restrictions of data usage (e.g., soil projects funded by private companies or corporations, soil data with privacy/confidentiality protection), while other soil projects funded by federal resources are considered public goods without data restrictions. Geographic coordinates are in some cases private data that need to be protected for confidentiality reasons and may be released only for public use in aggregated/masked format.",

GEMS also has policies reviewed by MSI’s Research Security and Compliance Analyst. All GEMS staff with access to private data sign an internal non-disclosure agreement designed by UMN’s Office of the General Counsel. All operations within the platform are isolated into encrypted containers where no other users have access (hence no snooping). Data entering or leaving these containers is also encrypted to prevent opportunity for leaks. All identifiable data residing in the platform are legally deemed private and non-public by the State of Minnesota, and hence not FOIAble. Finally, we provide users with various anonymization tools to de-identify their own data sets prior to sharing. These include removal of named identifiers, fuzzing and jittering of geo-coordinates and geospatial aggregation.\n\n1.4.1 Roles and Responsibilities\nPI Jelinski will be responsible ensuring the data management plan is followed by all project participants and will also be responsible for reporting compliance with this data management plan to NRCS. The annual and final reports to NRCS will have an expanded data management plan as an integral component, and will include progress in data sharing (e.g., statistics on shared and accessed data sets, publications, DOIs, outreach materials). The final report will describe the data that was produced during the award period and the components that will be stored and preserved (including the expected duration) after the award ends. The GEMS platform data steward will ensure that the data management plan will be compliant with the Research Terms and Conditions that govern NRCS-funded projects.",

We assume that these were collected with a GPS even if there is nothing that indicates it was collected by GPS.\nTier 3 – spatial coordinates collected between 2000 and 2010 but not explicitly identified as being collected with GPS. Coordinates may have come from a GPS, but it is possible that they were estimated by alternative means.\nTier 4 – pre-2000 GPS (US government agency), if a GPS unit was being used by a US government agency prior to selective availability being turned off (May 1, 2000), it is still likely that the government issued GPS unit was not subject to selective availability, however we cannot be certain.\nTier 5 – pre-2000 GPS (non-US government), even if collected with a GPS, selective availability was turned on before this (it specifically ended May 1, 2000) so quality is suspect.\nTier 6 – pre-2000 Aerial Photo/Topo Annotation, georeferencing was accomplished by annotation of approximate site location on an aerial photo or topographic map.\nTier 7 – pre-2000 Location Description, georeferencing was accomplished by a metes and bounds description of the approximate site location (i.e. 200m NE from the NW corner of section 36 in township and range X and Y).",

Note that the depths of observation and soil physical and chemical properties required to make unambiguous classifications depend on the taxonomic entity in question. For example, if there is permafrost within 1m of the soil surface, no morphology or laboratory data is necessary to make the unambiguous classification to the Gelisol soil order (Tier 1). However, if no other information is available, then classification to the suborder is not possible (Tier 4). This classification certainty ranking is there applied as a field metadata tag to each level of taxonomic classification, which are held in independent fields:\n\nTier 1 – unambiguous classification; all necessary morphological or soil physical and chemical data are available\nTier 2 – partially ambiguous classification; unambiguous morphological data, but missing some required soil physical or chemical data, few assumptions made regarding soil features and properties\nTier 3 – largely ambiguous classification; morphological data not available to requisite depth or missing key properties, and and/or missing required soil physical or chemical data\nTier 4 – no classification possible; limited morphological data and laboratory data available\n\nThere may be other tiers that are worth considering.",

Unlike similar efforts in the conterminous United States that primarily rely on USDA-NRCS NASIS and KSSL databases, Alaska presents unique challenges due to significant gaps in NASIS/KSSL coverage and the existence of numerous diverse non-NRCS datasets with limited spatial overlap.\nThe AKSDB data model has been developed with several key principles: - Transparent sourcing of raw data - No modification of source data on ingestion - Enhanced metadata enrichment - Transparent harmonization via scripting - Delivery of publicly available datasets to WoSIS/NASIS/ISCN",

    "text": "6.2 Introduction\nThe Alaska Soil Data Bank (AKSDB) pedon morphological model represents a novel approach to storing and representing soil pedon morphological data. Unlike traditional one-dimensional representations that treat soil horizons as simple layers with top and bottom depths, this model allows for the representation of complex two-dimensional soil morphology, particularly important in cryoturbated soils and other situations where horizon boundaries are not strictly horizontal.\n\n6.2.1 Background and Motivation\nTraditional soil databases typically represent soil horizons using a one-dimensional model where each horizon is defined by its top and bottom depths. While this approach works well for many situations, it fails to capture the complexity of soil morphology in cases where:\n\nHorizons have irregular boundaries\nMultiple horizons exist at the same depth (overlapping horizons)\nCryoturbation has created complex patterns\nHorizon components are distributed non-uniformly\n\nThe AKSDB pedon morphological model aims to address these limitations while maintaining compatibility with existing soil databases and ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.\n\n\n6.2.2 Design Goals\nThe pedon morphological model has been developed with several key objectives:\n\nFlexibility: Support both simple one-dimensional and complex two-dimensional representations\nEfficiency: Minimize storage requirements while maintaining data integrity\nInteroperability: Ensure compatibility with both Python and R\nHuman Readability: Maintain reasonable human readability in the stored format\nIntegration: Seamless integration with the existing AKSDB data model\nScalability: Support for large datasets (40,000+ pedons)",

The compression is particularly effective for this type of data due to the common occurrence of repeated patterns and long runs of identical values.",

The chosen implementation balances storage efficiency with usability and maintains compatibility with existing systems while supporting future expansion.\nThe model’s ability to handle both traditional one-dimensional profiles and complex two-dimensional representations makes it particularly valuable for Arctic and subarctic soils where cryoturbation and other processes create complex morphological patterns. The use of JSON as a storage format provides a good balance of human readability and machine processing efficiency while ensuring broad compatibility across different programming languages and platforms.\nAs development continues, the focus will be on addressing the identified action items and expanding the model’s capabilities while maintaining its core principles of flexibility, efficiency, and usability.",

This rule can be adapted to data contributors in the context of what is likely to be a large data acquisition effort for this project. If someone was substantially involved in data collection or curation on datasets that form a core part of this work and also provides substantive comment or feedback on a manuscript draft, they should be considered for co-authorship.",
